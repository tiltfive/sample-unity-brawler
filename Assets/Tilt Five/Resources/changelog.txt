  advised for new projects
  * Assign a parent transform for the player's head pose in the per-player prefab during instantiation instead of setting it immediately after
  * Fix an issue in Wand discovery when using Input System, no longer assigns multiple Wands to the wrong user

  * In Settings, there is now a toggle to allow or disallow the Camera Frame Sender to send IR Camera Frames from the Glasses, which is disabled by default
  * Show Glasses in the same order they will be acquired by games (including multi-player games)
  * Glasses attributes UI includes a new Health screen which can now display issues that have been seen since plugging in the Glasses (including a fix for Beta Issue #490)
  * A Volume Boost option has been added to the Glasses Info Actions tab. Note: it can cause audio to slightly clip or buzz in some conditions
  * For older production and all Beta Backer Glasses, report an unsupported USB speed correctly
  * Logging has been improved to be less noisy and the "Enhanced Logging" switch has been removed
  * "Beta" software banners appear when running beta versions of Control Panel, and a beta version number will appear on the bottom of the Control Panel

* Glasses
  * Perform pose prediction to anticipate movement, which greatly reduces a geometry "warping" effect most noticeable while moving your head sideways
  * Improve low-angle tracking so the Glasses can now track the board when you are closer to the surface
  * Integrate IMU data for tracking between visual tracking frames, improving pose re-acquisition after temporary loss of sight of the board

* Wands
  * Wands now report (in Control Panel) when they have a battery state too low to continue running
  * Wands now have a grace period for re-connection of a few seconds, when they are turned off or their batteries are removed

* Drivers and Tilt Five Software Install
  * Increase performance for generating Glasses images; can significantly improve frame rate for multiple Glasses
  * Fix issue where powering on two wands simultaneously could cause both wands to get the same address. To resolve, update the wand firmware for each wand. If wand firmware update is failing with multiple wands connected, turn off all wands, then turn on and update one at a time.
  * Fix a crash in the service when multiple Wands were being used
  * Added verification of system files at startup to prevent escalated security exploits
  * If the Service crashes or is stopped, all clients including the Control Panel must be restarted as they can no longer be considered trusted; the Control Panel will indicate this with a relevant error message and the system tray icon will automatically restart
  * The Tilt Five Glasses Camera Viewer has been moved to the Drivers install as it is a useful support tool
  * When the service restarts, flush stalled data that previously caused extra warnings to appear in logs
  * Service no longer deadlocks if clients are running when it is stopped, and restarts more cleanly
  * Control Panel will no longer show Glasses as still being used by the application if it exits without releasing the Glasses
  * Fix asynchronous USB pipe usage that would occasionally cause a crash in the Service
  * The Service no longer uses the Windows Event Log, and instead writes to rotating log files that are automatically cleaned up
  * Fix a crash that could occur when unplugging Glasses with connected Wands 
  * Enable better Glasses pose prediction based on SDK version and type; applications built using SDK version 1.3.0 and later will have a more accurate adjusted Glasses pose and more stable preview images on the host as a distinct motion-filtered preview pose is available in 1.3.0

* Developer Tools (Developer SDK)
  * If you are using the Mixcast SDK in your project, you should upgrade it to the latest version; Mixcast SDK version 2.5.1 and later is compatible with 1.3.0 when using TiltFiveManager2
  * Add `gameboard_transform` command line tool to experiment with tracking Gameboards at arbitrary rotations (tested primarily at 90 degrees on a wall) and/or scaling to a smaller or larger physical Gameboard size
  * The "Tilt Five Camera Viewer" tool is now in the Driver install and is renamed to "Tilt Five Glasses Camera Viewer"

* NDK (Developer SDK)
  * Add IR Camera Frame API to retrieve streams of images from the IR camera on each pair of Glasses
  * Rename the glasses "Acquire" operation to "Reserve" after much feedback from developers
  * Added a function for the NDK C++ interface to customize the SDK type, previously only supported by the C interface
  * Clean up and document more APIs

* Unity Plug-in (Developer SDK)
  * Add support for multiple simultaneously-connected Glasses for multiple local players using TiltFiveManager2 for multi-Glasses support. The original TiltFiveManager is kept for backward compatibility, but it does not support multiple Glasses; new projects should prefer TiltFiveManager2 over TiltFiveManager
  * Add support for specifying up to two Wands, right and left, per Glasses (both in TiltFiveManager and TiltFiveManager2)
  * Add IR Camera Frame API in Unity
  * Add multiple Player configuration tabs in TiltFiveManager2 for configuring the user experience for multiple Glasses
  * Move global system configuration information to its own panel in TiltFiveManager2
  * Add Upgrade button in Unity for TiltFiveManager to transfer settings to a new TiltFiveManager2 instance
  * Add upgrade steps documentation to ease transition to TiltFiveManager2
  * Camera template children objects now have an option to be cloned automatically
  * Log lack of plug-in as info level instead of error, don't log on unload
  * The Tilt Five Camera in the prefab now uses a smoothed glasses pose by default for an improved onscreen preview. If this camera was previously being used for tracking where the glasses are pointed, please either change to use an associated eye camera such as via `TiltFive.Glasses.GetLeftEye(PlayerIndex.One)` or use the pose information instead. For an example, see the SceneCursor scene in the Unity SDK examples.
  * Unity Action Maps can be defined for each Player's left and right Wands when using an `InputControlScheme` (a feature missing from the Beta, Issue #792)
  * Add notes about not using the Tilt Five Camera as a way to assume the Glasses pose since this is not likely to be correct in 1.3.0 and later in the SceneCursor example, which previously made this assumption
  * Default the TiltFiveManager2 prefab to GlassesMirrorMode.None, which provides a smoothed pose; other mirror modes result in using the real glasses pose for the respective eye(s) which has motion prediction applied, resulting in a very "shaky" image in the on-screen preview

  * Use direct DMA in and out on the Glasses for the IR Camera frame images, improving performance
  * Unity SDK Examples no longer require IL2CPP backend module (fixed Beta Issue #791)
  * Fix an exception that was being thrown on Unity scene switches (fixed Beta Issue #814)
  * Display.GetGlassesAvailability now reports when any Glasses are attached, not just the first player's Glasses (which might be removed during a game)
  * Fix the `gameboard_transform` developer tool to correctly track larger or smaller gameboards

* Known Issues for 1.3.0
  * Tooltip UI in the Unity Editor and the toString() method uses obsolete words primary and secondary for right and left wand enum #793
  * The `gameboard_transform` utility in the Developer SDK on Windows needs to run in a shell with Administrator privileges #884
